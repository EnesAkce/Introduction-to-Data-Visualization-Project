# DVProject – Member 3: Earthquake Analysis and Clustering

## 📌 Project Objective
This project aims to analyze **Turkey’s earthquakes from 1915 to February 2024** by:

- Investigating relationships between different magnitude types (MD, ML, Mw),  
- Clustering earthquakes based on **depth, magnitude, and location (K-Means)**,  
- Visualizing the relationship between magnitude and depth.  

The project is implemented as an **interactive Streamlit dashboard**.
